            <p class="bio-paragraph">
                After a year of academic and practical upskilling, I am actively transitioning into the tech industry to advance health and wellness using psychological theory, data science, and artificial intelligence. I aim to thrive in this new environment by leveraging my extensive background and strong work ethic. I am enthusiastic about working in dynamic and collaborative tech environments, utilizing my clinical expertise and emerging data science skills to drive innovation in healthcare.
            </p>
            <p class="bio-paragraph">
                With over 25 years of experience in clinical assessment, intervention, and psychotherapy and 18 years as a licensed psychologist, I have developed a distinctive skill set at the intersection of technology and healthcare. My expertise includes psychometrics, statistical reasoning, healthcare ethics, executive and life coaching, administration, and data science. I hold a bachelor's degree from Cornell University and an MS, EdS, and PhD from The Florida State University.
            </p>
            <p class="bio-paragraph">
                Additionally, I completed a Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Clinical Health Psychology from the University of Miami. I am pursuing the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and college credit certificates in Artificial Intelligence and Business Intelligence through Miami Dade College, alongside various digital tech badges and certifications.
            </p>
            <p class="bio-paragraph">
                My diverse career spans private practice, academia, hospitals, and service to the US government. I have integrated Clinical Psychology, Psychometrics, Positive Psychology, and Executive Coaching principles to develop data-driven mental health and wellness solutions. Notable accomplishments include leading my cohort during my predoctoral psychology internship at Jackson Memorial Hospital and receiving performance awards from past employers. Additionally, my roles as a board member and president of a national professional association have contributed to substantial membership growth. These experiences reflect my commitment to excellence and continuous professional development, qualities I bring to the tech industry.
