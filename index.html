            <p class="bio-paragraph">
                I have over 25 years of clinical experience in assessment, intervention, and psychotherapy, and I have been a licensed psychologist for over 18 years. My expertise covers psychology, psychometrics, executive and life coaching, administration, and data science. I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree from Cornell University, multiple graduate degrees including a PhD from The Florida State University, and a Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Clinical Health Psychology from the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami.
            </p>
            <p class="bio-paragraph">
                Throughout my career, I have held various clinical, academic, and administrative roles in private practice, hospitals, and government service. I integrate clinical psychology principles, the strengths-based approach of Positive Psychology, and Executive Coaching with psychometrics and data science. I am currently transitioning from clinical work to tech and focusing on health and wellness by applying data science and artificial intelligence.
